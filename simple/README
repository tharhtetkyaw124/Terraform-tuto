# SSH file to connect with AWS EC2
# ----------------------------------- 
it will be locate in the local user filesystem in ssh folder ~/.ssh
change the file permission, otherwise aws will reject the ssh file and throw an error "bad permission"
make as follow: 
                chmod 400 + file_name

    example:
                chmod 400 ec2Tutorial.pem 


connect ec2 instance through SSH 

1) open shell
2) ssh -i key_pairs_file ec2-user@PUBLIC_EC2_IP

example: 

        ssh -i EC2Tutorial.pem ec2-user@35.180.100.144

# SSH
# ---------------

# Where is localled and exist key?

 Remenber, local SSH key are localed in mac on ~/.ssh folder under the name id_rsa.pub  

# How create new SSH key?

#There is two way to remove source
#1.- Remove directly from the main.tf file
#2.- Apply the command "destroy" as follow: terraform destroy -target <source_type>.<source_name>  
#example terraform destroy -target aws_subnet.demo-subnet-2
#However, this not a good practice, use apply instead.  
#becouse after make destroy in the shell. the file doesn corresponde to the current state

#Terrform destroy
#without any arguments, it will be destroye each resource in the order in the code was writen.
#remove, destroy, clean

#apply auto-approve, this commands allows apply chnages without our confirmation question

#PLAN: this command will show the current state and the change to apply for  desire state.
#like un Git (git status)

#this command tell us that a new resource will be add

#To clean all configurstion file


# terraform state show <<name_of_resoruce >> 
  --------------------------------------------
We can see all the properties of a resource
